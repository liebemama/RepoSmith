---

## [0.2.6] - 2025-09-05
### Added
- Auto-generate `setup-config.json` with sane defaults via `load_or_create_config` + unit tests.

### Changed

### Fixed
- Minor CLI/logging refinements and safer idempotent file writes across helpers.

---

## [0.2.5] - 2025-09-04
### Added
- Support for direct `python -m reposmith` execution (module entry).

## [0.2.1] - 2025-09-04

## [0.2.0] - 2025-09-04
### Added
- Unified safe file-writing system (`write_file`) across all modules (atomic write + .bak + idempotent).
- CLI now prints state logs for each step (`[requirements]`, `[venv]`, `[pip]`, `[install]`, `[env-info]`, `[entry]`, `[ci]`).
- Fallback in VS Code settings: uses `python.exe`/`python3` if `.venv` not created.
- Config file generator (`setup-config.json`) with defaults.

### Changed
- `main.py` reorganized: no duplication, cleaner flow.
- Default entry file is now `main.py` instead of `app.py`.
